## Instructions

1. Open the project in IDE (Current to 21/04/2023 I'm using VSCode).
2. Open the following file in the 'src/settings/settings.js' file.
3. Search for the first setting - 'COMPONENT_MODE' - Make sure it is 'APP'.
4. Search for the 'ENVIRONMENT_MODE' - Make sure it is 'DEVELOPMENT'.
5. Next - Time to install the NPM packages. In the terminal run: 'npm i'.
   It will install automatically all the required NPM packages according to the
   production mode. If you see errors - Retry. If still got errors - Need to check what's wrong.
6. Once finished with the node_modules installation, You are ready to start the application.
